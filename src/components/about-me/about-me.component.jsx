            Before I became a software engineer, I was an entrepreneur that
            dabbled in digital marketing consulting before I ran two
            dropshipping businesses. I decided I wanted a hard skill that I
            could compound that also made sense for the future of society and
            technology at large. Software engineering stood out to me because I
            could combine my creativity with my passion for building and problem
            solving.{' '}
